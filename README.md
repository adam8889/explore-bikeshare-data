# explore-bikeshare-data

This program allows users to enter a city, month, and day of the week to receive data regarding bikeshare statistics

It first asks for the city, either Chicago, New York City, or Washington. Only one choice is allowed for this input.
Next, it asks for the month or months for which the user would like to see data. Multiple months can be selected, separated by a comma:

may, june or may,june. Only January through June are valid months.

It finally asks for the day of the week the user would like to see statistics for. Like the month input, multiple days of the week may be selected:

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday   or  monday, friday, saturday.

The inputs are not case sensitive.

The program then runs and shows several different statistics.
